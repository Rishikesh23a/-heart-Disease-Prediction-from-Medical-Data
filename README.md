❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient health attributes. The solution is developed and executed entirely on Google Colab.

📁 Dataset
- Source: heart (2).csv

- Attributes:

-- Age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, max heart rate, ST depression, etc.

-- Target: 0 (No heart disease), 1 (Heart disease)

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python

- Google Colab

- Pandas & NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- XGBoost

- Seaborn & Matplotlib

✅ Workflow

1.Dataset Upload

- Upload CSV directly in Colab environment

2.Data Preprocessing

- Drop nulls

- Feature-target separation

- Standardization using StandardScaler

3.Model Training & Evaluation

- ✅ Logistic Regression

- ✅ Random Forest

- ✅ XGBoost

- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4.Evaluation Metrics

- Classification Report

- Confusion Matrix

- Feature Importance (for Random Forest)

- ROC-AUC Curve

- Final Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score table for all models



📊 Visualizations

- Confusion Matrix (Random Forest)

- Feature Importance Graph

- ROC Curve

- Bar chart comparing model scores


🔮 Future Improvements

- Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

- Try ensemble stacking or voting classifiers

- Build a web app using Streamlit or Flask
